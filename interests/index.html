        I enjoy messing around my 3D printer at home when I have a chance. It is based off
        a cheap kit found on the internet that I bought back in the summer of 2016, but it
        has served me well and I have been able to use it to print some subjectively cool things
        such as USB flash drive holders, phone stands, in-game character models and was also
        used for the hinge for a dish rack on one of my IPRO projects.

      <h3>Anime</h3>
      <p>
        Watching anime is still one of my favorite things to do when I'm around a computer.
        I don't really know what I would classify as my favorite, but here is a short list of
        some titles in no particular order that I enjoyed watching.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>5 Centimeters Per Second</li>
        <li>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</li>
        <li>Steins;Gate</li>
        <li>Shakugan no Shana</li>
        <li>Your Name</li>

      <h3>Baking</h3>
      <p>
        I really enjoy baking whenever I can. It started off with those premade mixes and store
        bought ready-to-bake dough, but after a few runs I realized it would probably be better
        to start from scratch. Armed with the internet and the limitless amount of recipes you
        can find online, I started with a classic: the chocolate chip cookie.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not half bad, huh? It tasted pretty good too. I was pretty satisfied with the result. On
        the other hand, once you start baking and you realize it's pretty fun, there's no point
        stopping at plain old chocolate chip cookies (even though they were pretty awesome). I
        even tried to do that fancy little fruit garnish on the side with that chocolate swirl.

        Here are a few more pictures of some of the stuff I baked over the past few years. I'll
        admit not all of them were perfect. For example, for the cannoli bites, the dough shell
        ended up getting baked a bit too long and it turned out harder than I'd like. Macarons (not
        macaroons -- the coconut kind) are both fun and annoying to make. I swear most of the time
        I try to make them, they end up either cracking or just completely failing. The cake pops?
        Yeah, they look okay, but it ended up being a bit bland though. I probably should've added
        something else to the cake base to be honest.

      <aside>
        Most of the pictures taken on this page were taken with my Nikon D50 with the standard 28-80mm
        lens that came with the camera that I bought used off eBay a few years ago. You can probably
        tell which ones they were (hint: it's the first three images). I have no clue what I am doing
        half the time when I take pictures, but I can say for sure that it looks much better than what
        I can get with the camera on my phone.
